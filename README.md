# 💬 General Info

This documentation includes the general aspects to consider to run the app in a local environment and how it is deployed in a productive AWS environment.

# 👨🏻‍🚀 Local Installation

Instructions for local installation:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hfuentes/icd
$ cd icd
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

In some cases a problem could arise with the installation of deprecated dependencies, a possible solution is to use the ```npm i --legacy-peer-deps``` command.

# 📚 AWS Configuration

The configuration to deploy to a productive AWS environment is contained in the buildspec.yml file that indicates how AWS should install the dependencies to then be packaged and sent to the EC2 server managed by EBS.

There is also an additional configuration for the NGINX server contained in the root folder structure from .platform, the specific file is app.conf, this includes redefining the NGINX variables to control maximum upload file size and maximum wait time for requests.

# ⭐️ Deploy to AWS

To deploy to AWS you only need to merge changes to the ```aws``` branch. This process can be manual, using the following steps as an example:

```
on main branch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "chore: something"
$ git push
...if everything goes fine
$ git checkout aws && git pull
$ git merge main
$ git push
...return to main branch
```

The ```deploy.sh``` script is also available that performs the same process; the requirements are to be in the main branch and have changes to upload.

**⚡ Important! ⚡**

Before running the deploy, verify that the changes are what you want to upload, also take a look at the content of the script to make sure it will do what you require.
